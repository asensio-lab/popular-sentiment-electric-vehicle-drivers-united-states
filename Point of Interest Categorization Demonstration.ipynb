    "#   The best place from the places returned from Google Places was determined via name similarity. The \"Types\" (i.e. POI)\n",
    "#   for the place was then attached to the charging location. These locations with this additional data were then saved\n",

    "#   This program has two main components: the locations with Types/POI data from Google Places, \n",
    "#   and filter commands (saved in filterCommands.txt). filterCommands.txt contains a python dictionary with various POIs\n",
    "#   and has different keywords that can be given. Multiple keywords can be used together to increase/reduce the number of results\n",

    "#   defaulted to their PlugShare POI. Then, all non-US locations were filtered out, and the remaining location POIs\n",
    "#   were identified by hand by looking up the latitude and longitude in google maps, as well as looking up the name\n",
    "#   of the location. All POIs were then analyzed a second time by a human in excel to account for small errors that may have\n",
