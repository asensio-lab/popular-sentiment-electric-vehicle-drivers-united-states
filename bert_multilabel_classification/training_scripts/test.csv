Do that instead of what the other so-called ""Hybrid"" gas cars like Cary are using up instead of the Leaf's and e500 that's there. Because 4 (really 3 stations) and the 9 plug in vehicles that are parked cannot charge in 1 work day now.

Get the county to install MORE!

Technically the PHEV's and Hybrids should not have first stab at the chargers because they has gas and a backup way to drive. EV's don't (but Tesla's have their own proprietary charging network that they allow NO ONE else to play on). These 4 units are tax payer and county bond funded so they are PUBLIC no matter what. If UCLA Olive View wants to install chargers just for their own employees, then they can do that but they are a county hospital sitting on public land.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

There were no signs or warnings about the time limit that you can charge your car, or about the possibility of booting. So we filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs of NYC regarding they unlawful booting, in the absence of signs. Also, from DCA I found out that only towing companies are authorized to boot, the removal of the boot should be up to $25, paid in cash or credit, and the boot should be removed within 30 minutes from the time you paid the fine. They charged us $75 and demanded cash only. We are disputing this issue now and we'll let you know how it is going. Either way, it is illegal to be booted unless there are very obvious signs about that and the booting is done by a licensed company: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/booting_law_rules.pdf",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
