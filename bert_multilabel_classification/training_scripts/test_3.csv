They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.
