Connecticut DOT & Tesla Motors are jointly updating charging signage at the 2 Greenwich Service Plazas on the Merritt Pkwy (CT-15).  Due to high parking stall utilization at these plazas, posted stalls shall be used for SHARED parking or EV charging:  

Stalls are FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVE; 
Vehicle may EITHER park 15 minutes OR CHARGE 45 minutes; 
Vehicle must vacate stall after EITHER park OR charge cycle is complete.

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Smarter EV owners would know to learn about chargepoint prior to driving to one with only 9 miles of charge left. 

I parked, the unit was locked--meaning it needed the card to activate it. I don't have a card, so I went in the the Marriott to ask for one. 

They couldn't find it. After about 5 minutes I gave up and decided to crawl over to Amerigreen or the Hampton. 

But on a whim I called Chargepoint and learned they can unlock it from afar over the interwebs. This internet thing is going to be big. 

You can also unlock it from their app, but there's no mention of that at the app store. Important safety tip, Egon. 

They got me going and it's charging now. 

The Marriott staff were very friendly and accommodating--they just didn't know (like me) how it worked. I impressed upon them the importance of the staff knowing, and having a card handy.

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The charging is I think pretty much intended for guests, though the owner said also that a non-guest driving through is welcome to use the charging at this point (this writing is as of 2015-02-08).  I suggest to fellow EV drivers to make a good effort to be polite and express gratitude for use of the charging since there are very few public stations around this area.  The owner may at some point install J1772 or similar, but at this point it is just 120 Volt and NEMA 14-50.

The Volt is even more of an electric vehicle than a Prius, but they all have equal rights to plug in, first come first serve.  I wonder what their protocol is to charge.  I charged at the fair last week (blue Volt) and if I had seen a Prius there, I would've also tried to plug it in for them when I was done.  When I was there the other spot was open though.

Other providers such as Blink and Charge Point charge less or offer a better subscription plan for lower rates. Blink membership is free or low cost and offers $1 per hour L2 charging and $2 per hour non-member. L3 charging for members is approximately $5-8, depending on location, for members. Charge Point is comparably priced, depending on location. While it was handy having this DCQC, I'll avoid it in the future if possible as a poor value for approximately $3 worth of electricity with a $6.95 ""convenience charge"" for QC.

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

The rep said it was a one-time only favor and that essentially I should wait until they were fixed before relying on them again.  When I asked how I'd know without going there, he had no advice.  Great.  I hope it is soon (and that they develop a notification system as eVgo appears to have).

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

For some odd reason, the Chargepoint app was showing that one of the two chargers was in use, when in fact NEITHER was in use. After I plugged in, it showed that BOTH were in use. Must be a bug.

The grocery store has a deli with hot food and sushi, and it's a grocery store, so you can get pretty much anything you want (cold drinks, coffee, etc.)

The deli area has some tables and chairs to sit and eat at, and also has free WiFi. There was a picnic table and shade umbrella outside as well.

If you get some food ""to go"", do yourself a favor and walk one country block west to Tyranea Park. It's a little wooded park with plenty of picnic tables and access to Rock Lake. I sat down by the lake and ate lunch. When I got back to my electric motorcycle, it was fully charged.

6684,221549,"TESLA OWNERS - MODEL S UPGRADE - They have a brand new cable, Model S adapter and the Tesla approved socket to plug it into. With 40 amps, charged my P85D at 25 mi/hr. I arrived at 1:30am after 16 hours of driving (and charging).  Dario, the night welcomer in chief was so gracious. He got out the brand new Tesla cable and adapter and then, with his cell phone light, got it plugged into the Castle & connected the car. Full charge this morning!  Plus charger is at back of one of the two handicap spaces right next to the front door.  You have to be a guest but there's really nowhere else to go once you drive up the long drive to the top of the hill. GREAT destination connection though, as dinner guests at Equus often linger up to 4 hours so that's 100 extra miles if you need it (or just top off) or a full charge every night if you're staying here.  The staff is helpful and knowledgable - really top notch. Come on MODEL S OWNERS lets lobby to get a couple of the 100amp home chargers in here like the places along the west coast that have MADE themselves destinations for Model S owners, convenient and comfortable for the only long distance, fast and fun, total EV made (just drove from OR to San Fransisco, to here, NYC, 4500 miles + in new P85D in less then two weeks - home to north of Boston tomorrow).  Thank you PlugShare members who added crucial extra info to charging locations - I couldn't have made it without you. If you want to travel north of Boston my home charger will be listed tomorrow, and welcome. ",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

the L3 EVSE has a physical problem: the strain relief on the L3 coupler cable came lose (or was never installed correctly), thus that cable is possibly hanging by its  connected wires.

I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

However there is 1 needed in Indio, La Quinta or Palm Desert really bad. If that happens then you can get to Arizona from Los Angeles in 8 hours including charging up. Otherwise you have to stop in La Quinta for 3 hours and Chiriaco Summit for 3 1/2 hours to get enough charge to get to the nearest supercharger off the 10 frwy. Please Tesla you must build another Super Charge station in one or the areas I mentioned. It is soo needed. Otherwise it's a 13-15 hour trip instead of 8 hours.
