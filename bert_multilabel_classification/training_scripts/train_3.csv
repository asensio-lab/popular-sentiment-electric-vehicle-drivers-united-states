He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

I suggest to fellow EV drivers to make a good effort to be polite and express gratitude for use of the charging since there are very few public stations around this area.

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

According to my conversation with the company today, they said it was ok if I passed along to plugshare.com that:

Also, they announced a major event for grand opening event for May 12 that will feature the state capitol, this station, the Casa Grande and Speedway/I10 AMPM, and a TEDx presentation.

Smarter EV owners would know to learn about chargepoint prior to driving to one with only 9 miles of charge left. 

I parked, the unit was locked--meaning it needed the card to activate it. I don't have a card, so I went in the the Marriott to ask for one. 

They couldn't find it. After about 5 minutes I gave up and decided to crawl over to Amerigreen or the Hampton. 

But on a whim I called Chargepoint and learned they can unlock it from afar over the interwebs. This internet thing is going to be big. 

You can also unlock it from their app, but there's no mention of that at the app store. Important safety tip, Egon. 

They got me going and it's charging now. 

The Marriott staff were very friendly and accommodating--they just didn't know (like me) how it worked. I impressed upon them the importance of the staff knowing, and having a card handy.

Same guy tells me that one cannot park in the normal charge space and wait for quick charger too. I asked him how does one know when the Quickcharger is vacant?  He replies ""you have to take your chances.  Maybe check in every 30 minutes because I don't take reservations either.""  What the hell has he smoked?  This logic makes no sense if this is actually a policy or a terrible interpretation of one. For a city trying to be eco and EV friendly, this kinda nonsense just makes it even more difficult for people to transition out of guzzling gas.

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

2015-05-10
Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Do that instead of what the other so-called ""Hybrid"" gas cars like Cary are using up instead of the Leaf's and e500 that's there. Because 4 (really 3 stations) and the 9 plug in vehicles that are parked cannot charge in 1 work day now.

Get the county to install MORE!

Technically the PHEV's and Hybrids should not have first stab at the chargers because they has gas and a backup way to drive. EV's don't (but Tesla's have their own proprietary charging network that they allow NO ONE else to play on). These 4 units are tax payer and county bond funded so they are PUBLIC no matter what. If UCLA Olive View wants to install chargers just for their own employees, then they can do that but they are a county hospital sitting on public land.

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

For some odd reason, the Chargepoint app was showing that one of the two chargers was in use, when in fact NEITHER was in use. After I plugged in, it showed that BOTH were in use. Must be a bug.

The grocery store has a deli with hot food and sushi, and it's a grocery store, so you can get pretty much anything you want (cold drinks, coffee, etc.)

The deli area has some tables and chairs to sit and eat at, and also has free WiFi. There was a picnic table and shade umbrella outside as well.

If you get some food ""to go"", do yourself a favor and walk one country block west to Tyranea Park. It's a little wooded park with plenty of picnic tables and access to Rock Lake. I sat down by the lake and ate lunch. When I got back to my electric motorcycle, it was fully charged.

And besides that, there are many other places near by, if you are in need of emergency electricity.. And if you are in a hybrid plug in electric is very wrong to unplug a full electric car which does not have the facilities you have to just run up to a gas station and refuel in under a minute at thousands of places around town.

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Only charge for as long as you need to to get home, and plug in at home as well, don't abuse the chargers, others need them as well. Also, please leave a note on your vehicle, or on PlugShare, about if and when it would be acceptable to unplug your vehicle if you are not around and/or contact information to inquire. If your car is equipped with an unplug alarm, and you can't be contacted, please disable the alarm. To the Tesla specifically, I've notice you parked and plugged in day after day for hours and hours. Unless you have a VERY long drive to campus, I would have to assume you're abusing the system by not plugging in at home. Either way, please help the community in one of a few ways. A Tesla supercharger is located a few miles away, please use that if you need a lot of power. Also, your car has a ChaDeMo option, please invest in that option and use the fast charger. Many cars don't have a fast charge option, so a lengthy use of that would, in most cases, be ideal. Also, when your car is done charging, please move your car as soon as possible. To anyone who lives on campus, please refrain from using the chargers during the day which is when commuters may need them, a overnight charge is almost always perfectly fine.",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Especially if Nissan and other OEMs will pay for NCTC people. Can you blame them? These stations are expensive! If you really want to compete, install your own stations and start a price war.

The staff is helpful and knowledgable - really top notch. Come on MODEL S OWNERS lets lobby to get a couple of the 100amp home chargers in here like the places along the west coast that have MADE themselves destinations for Model S owners, convenient and comfortable for the only long distance, fast and fun, total EV made (just drove from OR to San Fransisco, to here, NYC, 4500 miles + in new P85D in less then two weeks - home to north of Boston tomorrow).

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

6217,157969,"Joel,  If you haven't been watching the EV Fast Charger prices, I can understand your reaction to our price.  Here is a sample of our Fast Charging competition.  The Blink network charges $0.65/kWh ($0.59 for members) and eVgo, charges $4.95 + $0.20/minute or &gt;$10 for a 30 minute charge.  The average fast charge at our site is about 10 kWh, which would be $8.90 for a charge of about 30 minutes.  Both Blink and eVgo networks were built on government grants with equipment not meant for a coastal environment.  

As for usage, we did not see a dramatic increase in usage when technical problems caused us to offer fast charging for free this summer and we have not seen a dramatic decrease in usage now that we have resumed charging for the power.

We are constrained by our costs.  Commercial power costs $0.24/kWh and we risk a $3.00/kWh demand charge if the fast charger causes us to exceed peak demand.  We also have network, insurance, security, rent and the installation costs.  The fast charger costs 6-7 times what the 220v charger costs, which means a higher price to use.
  
So, we're not going to offer fast charging at the same price as 220v charging, instead we offer drivers a choice.  You can balance the extra hour charging time versus the extra $5.00 for 10kWh.  The important thing is that an area of California that was not conveniently accessible to EVs now is.  We have customers using both chargers and we welcome everyone.

Sincerely,
Richard Sachen

You can use the cashier on the main floor or pay on exit with your credit card. EVSEs are not reserve-able, but you can check status on the Chargepoint website/app before you arrive.",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

That will set off whoever put this charger in as much as it sets me off for that person to be so inconsiderate to other ev drivers especially since that doctor is never parked there.,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
