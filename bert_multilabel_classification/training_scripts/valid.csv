Volt has 44 miles range usually  ( 55-60 in new model) with an electric generator powered by gasoline engine which is active when the battery is considered depleted. A driver can fully accelerate a volt to top speed and the gasoline generator will not turn on as long as battery is not empty.

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
