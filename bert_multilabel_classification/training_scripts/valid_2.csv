They are welcoming to EV drivers using their 120 Volt and NEMA 14-50 240 Volt sockets, though they are not EV drivers themselves.  The charging is I think pretty much intended for guests, though the owner said also that a non-guest driving through is welcome to use the charging at this point (this writing is as of 2015-02-08).  I suggest to fellow EV drivers to make a good effort to be polite and express gratitude for use of the charging since there are very few public stations around this area.  The owner may at some point install J1772 or similar, but at this point it is just 120 Volt and NEMA 14-50.  The plugshare entry indicates some sort of Tesla plug, but I think they are just referring to the NEMA 14-50.

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

1427,275557,"Paid $11 to fully charge a completely depleted BMW i3 (19 KWh).  Quite expensive (US$0.49 per KWh, as posted). There are no signs of the supposedly free city of Carmel blink card, so I used my own blink card. The charger worked great and fully charged the car from totally empty to full in 3.5 hours while we were enjoying the beach and dining.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
