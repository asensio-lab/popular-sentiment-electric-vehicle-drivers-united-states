9953,44435,"Hi folks. We charged there on Saturday, October 5, and although the charging itself was successful, they booted our Nissan. There were no signs or warnings about the time limit that you can charge your car, or about the possibility of booting. So we filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs of NYC regarding they unlawful booting, in the absence of signs. Also, from DCA I found out that only towing companies are authorized to boot, the removal of the boot should be up to $25, paid in cash or credit, and the boot should be removed within 30 minutes from the time you paid the fine. They charged us $75 and demanded cash only. We are disputing this issue now and we'll let you know how it is going. Either way, it is illegal to be booted unless there are very obvious signs about that and the booting is done by a licensed company: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/booting_law_rules.pdf",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

Connecticut DOT & Tesla Motors are jointly updating charging signage at the 2 Greenwich Service Plazas on the Merritt Pkwy (CT-15).  Due to high parking stall utilization at these plazas, posted stalls shall be used for SHARED parking or EV charging:  

Stalls are FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVE; 
Vehicle may EITHER park 15 minutes OR CHARGE 45 minutes; 
Vehicle must vacate stall after EITHER park OR charge cycle is complete.
